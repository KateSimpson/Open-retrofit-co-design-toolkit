# Open co-design retrofit toolkit

This toolkit aims to share resources that can inform the early stages of designing a retrofit project for a home. It is created within a template structure for research projects within the CRC/TRR 135 according to the results of a joint work with CRC 1158 and CRC 1315 (see https://genr.eu/wp/towards-a-standardized-research-folder-structure/) for details.

# Creator and invitation to contribute

This is initially created by Kate Simpson to open up knowledge around retrofit: kate.simpson@imperial.ac.uk but contributions are welcome from all. Please get in touch if you have ideas or send a request via GitHub.
